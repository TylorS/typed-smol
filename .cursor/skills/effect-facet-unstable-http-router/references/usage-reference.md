# Usage Reference: effect/unstable/http#router

- Import path: `effect/unstable/http#router`

## What It Is For

routing and method template surfaces. Module-specific APIs and usage patterns for Effect programs.

## How To Use

- Keep work focused on the `router` concern for `effect/unstable/http`.
- Assume unstable APIs can evolve quickly; isolate usage behind thin local adapters.
- Use the reference docs to select the smallest API surface that solves your task.
- Validate behavior against existing tests before introducing new usage patterns.

## Common Pitfalls

- Unstable module contracts may change; avoid coupling core app logic directly to experimental details.
- Prefer explicit, typed combinators over ad-hoc casting or unchecked assumptions.

## Starter Example

```ts
import { http } from "effect/unstable/http";

const value = http.Template();
```
