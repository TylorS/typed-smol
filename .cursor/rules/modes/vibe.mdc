# Vibe Mode

Use this mode for fast iteration with pragmatic guardrails.

## Required Stage Order

1. `planning`
2. `execution`
3. `finalization`

Load:

- `.cursor/rules/stages/planning.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/execution.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/finalization.mdc`

## Effect Skill Loading

- When any vibe-mode stage includes Effect work, load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Operating Style

- Optimize for momentum while keeping quality high.
- Use lightweight semantic planning first, then tactical replanning during execution.
- Skip heavyweight documentation, but still write essential transient artifacts in `.docs/workflows`.
- If uncertainty/risk rises, briefly backfill missing research or requirements before continuing.

## Minimum Deliverables

- A clear implementation plan with validation steps.
- Execution evidence (tests, checks, or manual verification notes).
- A concise finalization summary.
- Short-term memory notes in `workflows/<workflow_slug>/memory/` and explicit promotion/defer decisions for long-term memory.
- Use `.docs/_templates/` as the canonical starting point for required artifacts.
