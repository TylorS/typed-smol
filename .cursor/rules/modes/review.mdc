# Review Mode

Use this mode for evaluation, risk discovery, and actionable feedback.

## Required Stage Order

1. `review`
2. `finalization`

Load:

- `.cursor/rules/stages/review.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/finalization.mdc`

## Effect Skill Loading

- When review-mode work involves Effect code, load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Review Priorities

- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- Focus on behavioral regressions, correctness issues, risk, and missing tests.
- Keep summaries short after findings are listed.
- If no issues are found, state that explicitly and note residual risks/testing gaps.

## Deliverables

- Structured review artifact in `.docs/workflows/<workflow>/`.
- Final recommendation with clear next actions.
- Explicit note on memory impacts: new reusable lessons, corrected stale memory, and deferred promotions.
- Use `.docs/_templates/` as the canonical source for required artifacts.
