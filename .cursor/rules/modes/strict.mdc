# Strict Mode

Use this mode when correctness, auditability, and risk control are the top priorities.

## Required Stage Order

1. `brainstorming`
2. `research`
3. `requirements`
4. `specification`
5. `planning`
6. `execution`
7. `finalization`

For each stage, load and follow the matching rule:

- `.cursor/rules/stages/brainstorming.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/research.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/requirements.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/specification.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/planning.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/execution.mdc`
- `.cursor/rules/stages/finalization.mdc`

## Effect Skill Loading

- For any Effect-related stage activity, also load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Strict Guarantees

- Do not skip a stage unless the user explicitly asks to.
- Maintain requirement traceability from `requirements` to `planning` to `execution`.
- Use two-timescale planning: semantic DAG upfront + tactical local replanning at runtime.
- Add verification gates before mutating or high-risk actions.
- Persist outputs in `.docs` with clear stage ownership.
- Maintain memory traceability from short-term workflow memory to promoted long-term memory.
- Use `.docs/_templates/` as the canonical source when authoring required stage artifacts.

## Stage Exit Contract

At each stage boundary, provide:

1. Decisions made
2. Evidence used
3. Open risks/questions
4. Next stage readiness
