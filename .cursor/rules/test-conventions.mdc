# Test Conventions

## Assert Import

Tests MUST use `assert` from `vitest`, never from `node:assert`.

```ts
import { assert, describe, it } from "vitest";
```

For `deepEqual` / `deepStrictEqual`, use `assert.deepEqual` / `assert.deepStrictEqual` from the vitest import.

## Rationale

Single test runtime (Vitest); consistent imports; avoids mixing Node assert with Vitest runtime.
