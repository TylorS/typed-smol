# Research Stage

## Purpose

- Validate assumptions with evidence.
- Identify state-of-the-art options, trade-offs, and risks.
- Prepare inputs for requirements and specification.

## Core Actions

1. Review prior intent in `.docs/specs/`, prior decisions in `.docs/adrs/`, and relevant in-flight context in `.docs/workflows/`.
2. Define explicit research questions.
3. Gather evidence from primary sources first (papers, official docs, benchmarks).
4. Actively use `WebSearch` to discover relevant research papers; when recency matters, target the current year horizon (through 2026) and prioritize original paper links over secondary summaries.
5. Prefer the newest credible evidence when recency matters.
6. Record conflicting evidence and confidence level.
7. Translate findings into concrete implications for requirements and architecture.
8. Capture reusable findings in workflow short-term memory for possible long-term promotion.

## Effect Skill Loading (Required)

- When research involves Effect APIs or architecture, load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Artifact

Write:

- `.docs/workflows/<workflow_slug>/<asset-increment>-research.md`
- Start from `.docs/_templates/research.md`

Include:

- Research questions
- Source table (link, date/year, source type, confidence)
- `WebSearch` query log for paper discovery (queries used, rationale, and selected papers)
- Key findings
- Open risks/unknowns
- Implications for `requirements` and `specification`
- Alignment notes against consulted `.docs/specs/`, `.docs/adrs/`, and `.docs/workflows/`
- Memory promotion candidates (`procedural`, `mistakes`, `heuristics`, `benchmarks`)

## Quality Bar

- Avoid unsupported claims.
- Distinguish measured results from author claims.
- Note benchmark scope/limitations before generalizing.
- Verify paper metadata (title, authors, year, venue) from primary sources before citing.
- Label source maturity (peer-reviewed, preprint, vendor report, or other) and reflect that in confidence.
- Label confidence for any candidate memory intended for long-term reuse.

## Documentation Routing (Required)

- Keep durable behavioral intent in `.docs/specs/` and durable architecture decisions in `.docs/adrs/`.
- Keep exploratory notes and unresolved findings in `.docs/workflows/` until promoted.
- When findings conflict with existing durable docs, record the conflict explicitly and route updates to the canonical file rather than duplicating concepts.

## Exit Criteria

- Evidence is sufficient to define requirements.
- Major decisions have at least one credible supporting source.
- Remaining unknowns are explicitly listed.
- Reusable findings are captured for promotion to `.docs/_meta/memory/`.
