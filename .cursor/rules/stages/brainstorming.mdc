# Brainstorming Stage

## Purpose

- Frame scope, constraints, and outcomes.
- Surface unknowns early.
- Create a shared problem definition before deep research or implementation.

## Core Actions

1. Review existing context in `.docs/specs/`, `.docs/adrs/`, and relevant `.docs/workflows/` before proposing new directions.
2. Identify ambiguity in scope, priorities, constraints, and success criteria.
3. Ask targeted clarifying questions (prefer batched `AskQuestion` when choices are clear).
4. Capture candidate approaches with pros/cons and risks.
5. Propose a recommended direction when evidence is sufficient.
6. Define initial memory approach (short-term capture and long-term promotion) when relevant.

## Effect Skill Loading (Required)

- When brainstorming touches Effect-related work, load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Artifact

Write:

- `.docs/workflows/<workflow_slug>/<asset-increment>-brainstorming.md`
- Start from `.docs/_templates/brainstorming.md`

Include:

- Problem statement
- Desired outcomes
- Constraints and assumptions
- Known unknowns and risks
- Candidate approaches and recommendation
- Source grounding from `.docs/specs/`, `.docs/adrs/`, and `.docs/workflows/` (what was consulted and why)
- Initial memory strategy (if applicable)

## Documentation Routing (Required)

- Treat `.docs/specs/` and `.docs/adrs/` as durable context and constraints.
- Treat `.docs/workflows/` as transient run context; do not treat workflow notes as canonical decisions.
- If brainstorming surfaces a durable concept, mark it for promotion to a canonical destination instead of redefining it in multiple places.

## Communication Rules

- Ask only high-value questions that unblock decisions.
- Explain why each question matters.
- Keep questions specific and non-overlapping.

## Exit Criteria

- Ambiguities are reduced to a manageable list.
- Initial direction is agreed or explicitly deferred.
- Next stage inputs are documented.
