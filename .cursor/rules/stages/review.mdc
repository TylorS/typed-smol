# Review Stage

## Purpose

- Identify defects, risks, and regressions.
- Provide actionable, prioritized findings.

## Review Process

1. Inspect changes against requirements/spec/plan.
2. Prioritize issues by severity and user impact.
3. Highlight missing tests and residual uncertainty. When tests use hand-written examples for validators/guards, consider recommending property-based tests via `effect/testing/FastCheck` (`.docs/_meta/memory/property-testing-fastcheck.md`).
4. Recommend fixes and verification steps.
5. Review memory impacts: stale guidance risks, missing promotions, and recall quality.

## Effect Skill Loading (Required)

- When reviewing Effect-related changes, load and apply `.cursor/rules/effect-skill-loading.mdc`.

## Response Format

- Findings first, ordered by severity.
- Each finding should include:
  - What is wrong
  - Why it matters
  - Where it appears
  - Suggested fix path
- If no findings, state that explicitly.

## Artifact

Write:

- `.docs/workflows/<workflow_slug>/<asset-increment>-review.md`
- Start from `.docs/_templates/review.md`

Include findings, open questions, and test gaps.
Include memory findings when memory artifacts changed.

## Exit Criteria

- Review is complete and evidence-backed.
- Risks and follow-ups are explicit.
- Memory-related risks and follow-ups are explicit when applicable.
