# Monorepo Governance

Canonical policy definition lives in:

- `.docs/specs/monorepo-governance/spec.md`

When working in `apps/**` or `packages/**`:

- Treat `apps/` as entrypoints and `packages/` as reusable shared capabilities.
- Follow package naming and TypeScript workspace conventions from the canonical spec.
- Prefer existing workspace capabilities before adding new third-party dependencies.
- Use the dependency intake process in the canonical spec for any new library.
- Keep this file pointer-oriented; do not duplicate the full governance policy here.
